## Introduction to BGP

**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** is the standard exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path vector protocol and is the protocol that makes the Internet work by enabling different networks to communicate with each other.

### Why BGP is Important
- **Internet Backbone**: BGP is the routing protocol that holds the Internet together
- **Policy Control**: Allows network administrators to implement routing policies
- **Scalability**: Handles the massive scale of Internet routing (800,000+ routes)
- **Loop Prevention**: Uses AS-path information to prevent routing loops

---

## BGP Fundamentals

### Basic Concepts

**Autonomous System (AS)**
An AS is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of one entity that presents a common routing policy to the Internet.

```
AS Numbers:
- 16-bit AS Numbers: 1 to 65535
- 32-bit AS Numbers: 1 to 4294967295
- Private AS Numbers: 64512-65534 (16-bit), 4200000000-4294967294 (32-bit)
```

### BGP Characteristics
- **Protocol Type**: Path Vector Protocol
- **Transport Protocol**: TCP (Port 179)
- **Administrative Distance**: 20 (eBGP), 200 (iBGP)
- **Metric**: Uses path attributes instead of traditional metrics
- **Algorithm**: Best Path Selection Algorithm

```

### BGP Peering Relationships

#### eBGP (External BGP)
- Between routers in different AS
- Direct connection or multihop
- Administrative distance: 20
- Next-hop is usually changed

#### iBGP (Internal BGP)
- Between routers in the same AS
- Full mesh or route reflector
- Administrative distance: 200
- Next-hop is preserved

## BGP Attributes

BGP uses path attributes to make routing decisions. Attributes are classified as:

### Well-Known Mandatory Attributes

#### 1. ORIGIN
Indicates how the route was injected into BGP.
- **IGP (i)**: Route originated from IGP
- **EGP (e)**: Route learned via EGP
- **Incomplete (?)**: Route redistributed from other sources

#### 2. AS_PATH
List of AS numbers the route has traversed.
```
AS_PATH: 100 200 300 (route passed through AS 300, 200, then 100)
```

#### 3. NEXT_HOP
IP address of the next router to reach the destination.

### Well-Known Discretionary Attributes

#### 4. LOCAL_PREFERENCE (LOCAL_PREF)
Used within an AS to prefer one exit point over another.
- Higher value preferred
- Default: 100
- Only exchanged between iBGP peers

#### 5. ATOMIC_AGGREGATE
Indicates route aggregation occurred with potential information loss.

### Optional Transitive Attributes

#### 6. AGGREGATOR
Identifies the router and AS that performed route aggregation.

#### 7. COMMUNITY
Used to group destinations and apply routing policies.
- Format: AS:Value (e.g., 100:80)
- Well-known communities:
  - NO_EXPORT (65535:65281)
  - NO_ADVERTISE (65535:65282)
  - LOCAL_AS (65535:65283)

### Optional Non-Transitive Attributes

#### 8. MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED)
Suggests preferred entry point into an AS.
- Lower value preferred
- Only compared between routes from same AS

#### 9. ORIGINATOR_ID
Prevents routing loops in route reflector environments.

#### 10. CLUSTER_LIST
Prevents routing loops in route reflector clusters.

## BGP Path Selection Process

BGP uses a systematic process to select the best path:

### BGP Best Path Algorithm

```
1. Prefer route with highest WEIGHT (Cisco proprietary)
2. Prefer route with highest LOCAL_PREFERENCE
3. Prefer route originated locally (network/redistribute)
4. Prefer route with shortest AS_PATH
5. Prefer route with lowest ORIGIN (IGP < EGP < Incomplete)
6. Prefer route with lowest MED (same AS only)
7. Prefer eBGP over iBGP routes
8. Prefer route with lowest IGP metric to BGP next hop
9. For eBGP routes, prefer oldest route
10. Prefer route from router with lowest Router ID
11. Prefer route with shortest CLUSTER_LIST
12. Prefer route from lowest neighbor address
```

### Path Selection Flow Diagram

```
[Route Received]
       │
       ▼
[Valid Route?] ──No──→ [Reject]
       │Yes
       ▼
[Higher Weight?] ──Yes──→ [Select]
       │No
       ▼
[Higher LOCAL_PREF?] ──Yes──→ [Select]
       │No
       ▼
[Locally Originated?] ──Yes──→ [Select]
       │No
       ▼
[Shorter AS_PATH?] ──Yes──→ [Select]
       │No
       ▼

## BGP Peering Types

### 1. Customer-Provider Relationship
```
    Provider (AS 100)
         │
    [Pays for transit]
         │
    Customer (AS 200)
```
- Customer pays provider for Internet access
- Provider advertises customer routes to everyone
- Customer receives full/partial routes from provider

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Relationship
```
    Peer A (AS 100) ←──Settlement-free──→ Peer B (AS 200)
```
- Mutual agreement to exchange traffic
- Usually settlement-free
- Each peer advertises only customer routes

### 3. Sibling Relationship
```
    Parent Company
         │
    ┌────┼────┐
    │         │
  AS 100   AS 200
 (Sibling) (Sibling)
```
- Different AS under same organization
- Share all routes between siblings

### BGP Peering Diagram

                   Tier 2 ISP     Peer──→ Tier 2 ISP
                    (AS 200)              (AS 300)
                        │
                   [Provider]
                        │
                   Enterprise
                    (AS 400)
```

## BGP Configuration Examples

### Basic eBGP Configuration

**Router A (AS 100):**
```
router bgp 100
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 200
 neighbor 192.168.1.2 description "Connection to AS 200"
 
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  network 10.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 activate
 exit-address-family
```

**Router B (AS 200):**
```
router bgp 200
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 100
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 description "Connection to AS 100"
 
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  network 172.16.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 activate
 exit-address-family
```

### iBGP with Route Reflector

**Route Reflector:**
```
router bgp 100
 bgp router-id 1.1.1.1
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 100
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 route-reflector-client
 neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 100
 neighbor 10.0.0.3 route-reflector-client
```

**Route Reflector Client:**
```
router bgp 100
 bgp router-id 2.2.2.2
 neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 100
```

## BGP Security

### Common BGP Security Issues

#### 1. Route Hijacking
Unauthorized announcement of IP prefixes belonging to other organizations.

#### 2. Route Leaks
Violation of routing policies, typically announcing routes to unintended peers.

#### 3. AS Path Manipulation
Artificially modifying AS paths to influence routing decisions.

### BGP Security Mechanisms

#### 1. Route Filtering
```
ip prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN permit 192.168.1.0/24
ip prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN deny 0.0.0.0/0 le 32

router bgp 100
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN in
```

#### 2. AS Path Filtering
```
ip as-path access-list 1 permit ^200$
ip as-path access-list 1 deny .*

router bgp 100
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 filter-list 1 in
```

#### 3. Maximum Prefix Limits
```
router bgp 100
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 maximum-prefix 1000 warning-only
```

#### 4. BGP Authentication
```
router bgp 100
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 password cisco123
```

## BGP Troubleshooting

### Common BGP Issues

#### 1. BGP Session Not Establishing
**Symptoms:**
- BGP neighbor state stuck in Active/Connect
- No route exchange

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```
show ip bgp summary
show ip bgp neighbors [address]
debug ip bgp events
```

**Common Causes:**
- Incorrect AS numbers
- TCP connectivity issues
- Authentication mismatch
- Access lists blocking TCP 179

#### 2. Routes Not Being Advertised
**Troubleshooting:**
```
show ip bgp [network]
show ip bgp neighbors [address] advertised-routes
show ip bgp neighbors [address] routes
```

#### 3. Suboptimal Path Selection
**Analysis:**
```
show ip bgp [network]
show ip bgp neighbors [address] received-routes
show ip route bgp
```

### BGP State Machine

```
[Idle] → [Connect] → [OpenSent] → [OpenConfirm] → [Established]
   ↑                                                      │
   └──────────────── Error/Timer Expiry ──────────────────┘
```

**States Explained:**
- **Idle**: Initial state, no BGP activity
- **Connect**: Attempting TCP connection
- **OpenSent**: TCP connection established, OPEN message sent
- **OpenConfirm**: OPEN message received and processed
- **Established**: BGP session fully operational
